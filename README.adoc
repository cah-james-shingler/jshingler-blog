# jshingler.github.io

This is the repo that generates http://jshingler.github.io, a Static Website / Blog Hosted on github.

I was inspired by https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-heintz-93821513a[Drew Heintz's] work in generating his resume using https://gohugo.io/[Hugo] and
https://www.linkedin.com/in/sasiperi/[Sasi Peri's] github.io https://https://sasiperi.github.io/[blog].

Given my love of http://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc] specifically, https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] I found a couple of references that led me to building my http://jshingler.github.io site using the following technologies:

* github.io site
* Hugo
* Hugo Universal Theme
* AsciiDoc and AsciiDoctor
* Google Prettify for syntax highlighting
* VS Code
* Google Analytics Key
* Google Map Key
* Email with Formspree
* Disque for comments

## Basic Setup

1. Have Github account
2. Install AsciiDoctor
3. Install Hugo
4. Generate New Hugo Site
5. Install Hugo Universal Theme and Tweak

## Everyday Usage

* ```hugo server -D``` Good for local dev site http://localhost:1313 - includes draft items otherwise; ```hugo server```
* ```hugo```  generates site to the public directory
* publish to github with ```deploy.sh```
* Basic git commands to push this source repo
