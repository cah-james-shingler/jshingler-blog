*Status: Work In Process*

During the holidays, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, I take time to reflect on the previous year and focus on learning something.  2019 Holiday, one of the things I have decided to learn about is Kubernetes Operators.

I am going to use this blog to record my learnings, thoughts, questions, and the resources I am using to learn.

## Where I started

Two Good Introductory Videos from KubeCon 2018:
