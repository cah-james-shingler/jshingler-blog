# Pearl Harbor Day

December 7, 1941,78 Years ago, was a day we should never forget.  Many people lost their lives that day. 


We should never forget the ultimate sacrific that was made by the Greatest Generation.


Please Take a minute to pray for all of our veterans past, present, and future.


**May God watch over you.**
