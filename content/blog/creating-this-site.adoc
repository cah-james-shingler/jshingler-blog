While I am not new to blogging, I was re-inspired by https://www.linkedin.com/in/sasiperi/[Sasi Peri], a coworker, and her new https://sasiperi.github.io/[blog].  This gave me the itch to share my experiences and information with hope of helping others.

Now that I was re-inspired to blog, I had a fortunate conversation with https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-heintz-93821513a/[Drew Heintz].  Drew is a bright young man finishing up his Computer Science and Security degrees from https://rit.edu[RIT].  Drew, shared with me that he did his resume using https://gohugo.io[Hugo].  Hugo is similar to https://github.com/jekyll[jekyll static site generator] only written in https://golang.org[go] instead of https://ruby-lang.org[ruby].

After a little searching, I ran across https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3[Giraffe Academy Youtub Hugo Tutorial]. In addition, I found that Hugo and https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor], one of favorite tools, could be used together, https://rgielen.net/posts/2019/creating-a-blog-with-hugo-and-asciidoctor/["Creating a Blog with Hugo and AsciiDoctor"].

NOTE: Start with https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3[Giraffe Academy Youtub Hugo Tutorial].

Properly motivated and educated, I set the following goals:

* host at: https://jshingler.github.io
* make publishing as easy as possbile and looking great
** Hugo
** Hugo Themes
** Asciidoctor
** Well Formated Code with CueBalls

While I have a good bit of experience building Websites, I am far from a Designer.  Lucky for me, Hugo has https://themes.gohugo.io/[Themes]. After previewing the themes, I landed on the https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-universal-theme/[Universal Theme].  It is a great looking theme with a ton of features, more than I need, and good instructions on configuring them.

From there it was time to give it a shot.
