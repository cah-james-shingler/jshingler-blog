STATUS: Work in process, I will continue to flush this out.

While I am not new to blogging, I was re-inspired by https://www.linkedin.com/in/sasiperi/[Sasi Peri], a coworker, and her new https://sasiperi.github.io/[blog].  This gave me the itch to share my experiences and information with hope of helping others.

Now that I was re-inspired to blog, I had a fortunate conversation with https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-heintz-93821513a/[Drew Heintz].  Drew is a bright young man finishing up his Computer Science and Security degrees from https://rit.edu[RIT].  Drew, shared with me that he did his resume using https://gohugo.io[Hugo].  Hugo is similar to https://github.com/jekyll[jekyll static site generator] only written in https://golang.org[go] instead of https://ruby-lang.org[ruby].

After a little searching, I ran across https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3[Giraffe Academy Youtub Hugo Tutorial]. In addition, I found that Hugo and https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor], one of favorite tools, could be used together, https://rgielen.net/posts/2019/creating-a-blog-with-hugo-and-asciidoctor/["Creating a Blog with Hugo and AsciiDoctor"].

Properly motivated and educated, I set the following goals:

* host at: https://jshingler.github.io
* make publishing as easy as possbile and looking great
** Hugo
** Hugo Themes
** Asciidoctor
** Well Formated Code with CueBalls

While I have a good bit of experience building Websites, I am far from a Designer.  Lucky for me, Hugo has https://themes.gohugo.io/[Themes]. After previewing the themes, I landed on the https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-universal-theme/[Universal Theme].  It is a great looking theme with a ton of features, more than I need, and good instructions on configuring them.

From there it was time to give it a shot.

NOTE: Start with https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3[Giraffe Academy Youtub Hugo Tutorial] and https://charly3pins.github.io/post/building-static-blog-with-hugo/[Building a Static Blog with Hugo]

## Install Tools

I'll assume you already know https://git-scm.com/[Git] and have a http://github.com[Github] account.

### Install Go

Hugo uses http://golang.org[go]. https://golang.org/dl/[Installation Instructions]

### Install AsciiDoctor

AsciiDoctor has a good installation https://asciidoctor.org/docs/install-toolchain/[instructions] 

NOTE: AsciiDoctor requires ruby



### Install Hugo

I am a Mac guy, so I installed Hugo from the https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#install-hugo-from-tarball[tarball].

## Getting Started

Loads of Credit to https://charly3pins.github.io[Charly3pins] and his posting  https://charly3pins.github.io/post/building-static-blog-with-hugo/[Building a Static Blog with Hugo]

### Create Empty Site

```source,bash
hugo new site jshingler
```

results in:

CAUTION: Insert Pic of Fresh Site

### Setup a Theme

.Because we are good devs, initialize git
```source,bash
cd jshingler
git init
```

I chose the https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-universal-theme/[Universal Theme] from the https://themes.gohugo.io/[Hugo Themes] you choose what you like best.

```source,bash
git clone https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme.git themes/hugo-universal-theme
```

NOTE: If you haven't already done it, ... Do yourself a favor, watch the https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3[Giraffe Academy Youtub Hugo Tutorial]

Explore the theme, ... A really good place to look is the example site.  You can find it at: ```themes/hugo-universal-them/exampleSite```

### Tune the Theme

The universal theme is pretty robust, ... It has a lot of features that I really don't need for a Minimum Viable Product.  The ```config.toml``` file is used to configure the features.

### Local Development

```source,bash
hugo server -D
```

Dash D, ```-D```, allows draft content to be servered,  Not check it out http://localhost:1313

#### Add Content

```source,bash
hugo new blog/creating-this-site.adoc
```

### Publish to Github

CAUTION: Add Info on publishing to github.io


.deploy.sh - slightly modified from Charly3Pins
```source,bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x

echo -e "\033[0;32mDeploying updates to GitHub...\033[0m"

# Remove old Stuff  <1>
cd public
rm -fr *
cd .. 

# Build the project.
hugo # if using a theme, replace with `hugo -t <YOURTHEME>`

# Go To Public folder
cd public

# Add changes to git.
git add .

# Commit changes.
msg="rebuilding site `date`"
if [ $# -eq 1 ]
  then msg="$1"
fi
git commit -m "$msg"

# Push source and build repos.
git push origin master

# Come Back up to the Project Root
cd ..
```

<1> If you delete something from the site, if you really want it to be delete, you need to clean out the ```public``` directory.

## MORE TO COME!!!

''''

Content:

* Enable Google Maps
* Enable Google Analytics
* Submit for Google Indexing - put file in static
* Enable Disqus
* Enable ContactMe Formspree


## What's Next

Ren√© at his https://rgielen.net/about/[blog] has a pretty good article about 
https://rgielen.net/posts/2019/creating-a-dockerized-hugo-asciidoctor-toolchain/[Creating a Dockerized Hugo + AsciiDoctor Toolchain].  Next, I am thinking about using this with https://help.github.com/en/actions[GitHub worksflows and actions] to that when I push a change to the master branch of my repository, the website is automatically rebuilt and published.
